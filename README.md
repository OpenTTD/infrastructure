Sometimes there is an issue with OpenTTD, that is not related to any current Github project.
Often these issues are now spread around between different projects, like [website](https://github.com/OpenTTD/website) or [OpenTTD](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD)
This is not ideal, as these issues are not related to these projects, and tend to be forgotten/lost/closed.
This repository exists explicitly to bundle these kind of issues in a single place.

Examples:
- BaNaNaS bugs, issues, etc
- IPv6 issues
- API documentation issues
- Download issues
